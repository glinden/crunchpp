Crunchpp is a HTML5 WebGL game.  It works best in Chrome, but should
play in most recent browsers and on some mobile devices.  It is
publicly available at

This is a simple game where you are a predator attacking prey.  You
slowly lose energy to hunger and when attacking prey, but gain energy
when you kill prey.  The prey gains energy over time (supposedly from
sunlight or grazing) and breeds when their energy is high enough.  You
lose the game when your energy hits zero and complete a level when you
eliminate all the prey.

As the player can only attack one prey at a time, tight clusters of
prey are dangerous to the player, and the best strategy in the game is
to avoid attacking too much prey at once and to make sure to finish
off prey you have started to attack.  There's some fun parallels to
some of the old artificial life work from back in the 1990s -- the
simulation kinda-sorta looks like real world situations where
predators try to isolate prey and can be in danger if they get
surrounded by prey -- but I'd guess I'm just showing my age talking
about things like that.

The game is written in Javascript, runs a simple custom constraint
based physics system, demonstrates how to use Three.js, and attempts
to use WebGL with falling back to using canvas.  I hope the code is
useful to others in building their own games.

This game is free to play and my code for it is open source (MIT
license).  The audio files are public domain (from freesound.org) and
Three.js is covered by its own license, and please refer to those for
reuse terms.
