Crunchpp is a HTML5 WebGL game.  It works best in Chrome, but plays in
most recent browsers and on some mobile devices (falling back to
2D and dropping sound as necessary).  It is publicly available at

This is a simple game where you are a predator attacking prey.  You
slowly lose energy to hunger and when attacking prey, but gain energy
when you kill prey.  The prey gains energy over time (let's say from
sunlight or grazing) and breeds when their energy is high enough.  You
lose the game when your energy hits zero and complete a level when you
eliminate all the prey.

The game is written in Javascript, runs a simple custom
constraint-based physics system, uses Three.js, and shows off a little
WebGL with falling back to using canvas.  I hope the code is useful to
others in experimenting with WebGL and their own games.

This game is free to play and my code for it is open source (MIT
license).  The audio files are public domain (from freesound.org) and
Three.js is covered by its own license, and please refer to those for
reuse terms.
